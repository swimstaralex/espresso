<p>Who doesn't know the moment when you don't move the mouse of your computer for a short time and your machine dims the display. This can be quite annoying if one does handwritten work (yes even in 2016 this happens, at least for me) and one just displays information on the mac. The energy-saving-settings are set in a way that OS X starts dimming the display after only a few minutes, because usually this behavior is totally intended, however just not for this time...
Power users will know the terminal command 'caffeinated' will do the trick but it's inconvenient to always type in a command line.</p>

<p>This application can be used to trigger the terminal command 'caffeinate' conveniently through a menu bar icon.
In settings you can adjust the time for which the app should stop your mac from sleeping, you can choose between 10 to 10800 seconds (that's exactly three hours) and an infinite mode.</p>

<p>For me (a student) it was annoying to type the same lines in terminal every single day when I was doing my Math exercises (I usually have the tasks as a PDF, but don't actively use my mac during Math work). Luckily I started learning Apples Swift as soon as it was released and therefore could do the coding myself. Maybe this is helping people who have the same problem :)
At least thanks for reading as far as this.</p>
